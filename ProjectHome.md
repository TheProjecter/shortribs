Project locates prime numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence.

This project calculates Fibonacci Primes by testing every possible factor (hence finds them the hard way).  This is done to prove that the number is prime and not a probable prime.  Only Fibonacci Numbers that return zero factors are returned as prime.

All Fibonacci Numbers found are given their own XML file with their function number, high number, low number, prime status, and factors (if prime status is false).
